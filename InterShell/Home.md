# 2MAN Tools

**Tools to automate web development for a 2MAN Stack project**

Current implementation: a Windows console application.
 
**2MAN Tools** can be added as an external tool to the Visual Studio or
run interactively by [InterShell](https://github.com/mikesoloviev/intershell).

**2MAN Tools** executes the template files, which run the installation 
procedures and create or modify the web app files. 

The [current set of templates](./03-Templates) helps to create 
an example of a [2MAN Stack](https://github.com/mikesoloviev/2man-stack)
web app. 

The user can also [customize](./04-Customization) templates 
and apply them to automate a variety of web development tasks.

The templates are written in [Smilup](./05-Smilup) -- a simple 
markup language (the file extension `.sut`) and their 
customization can be done just by editing templates in any text editor.

The templates are located in the same folder where _2mantools.exe_ 
is installed.
